# ClimateProject

## Overview
This project focuses on ethical AI in climate change mitigation. The aim is to build machine learning models to predict temperature categories and mitigate biases using techniques like XGBoost and fairness libraries like AIF360.

## Contents
- `Pavan_Complete_Code.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and bias mitigation.
- `Weather Training Data.csv`: The training dataset used for building the model.
- `Weather Test Data.csv`: The test dataset used for evaluating the model.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- aif360
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost aif360 matplotlib seaborn shap

Usage:
git clone https://github.com/PavanKumar-sudo/ClimateProject.git
